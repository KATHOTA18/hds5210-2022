# Week 3 Feedback

Please name your folders for assignments as instructed in class.  Your folder should have been named "week03" without the underscore. You don't need to fix your week 2 or week 3 folders, but please use the correct naming on future assignments.

In 14.4, your `score = ...` line is indented too far, meaning that a score will only be calculated when ed_visits reaches the `else` condition.  You need to out-dent that line one level.

In 14.3, you missed adding `score_4` to your total score.
