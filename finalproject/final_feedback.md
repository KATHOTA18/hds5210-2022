# Feedback on Final

Good work on the final project overall.  A few notes:
1. I didn't see you setup for us any information about how this project could be applied in the real world in the future. (-1 Problem Applicability)
2. Remember to use variable names that tell us what the data is `df` is not usually a good variable name unless you're just demonstrating how dataframes work
3. The project asked you to use functions, but what is the value of a function called `remove_nan()` that simply calls `df.dropna()`?  or `drop_column()` that simply calls `df.drop()`?  Those seem wasteful. (-2 from Modularly / Style)
4. I could have used more documentation along the way describe why you were doing what you were doing.
